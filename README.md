# mernstack-deployment

A fun little **Full-stack MERN Application**, completely hosted and deployed on cloud and integrated with GitHub to have automatic deployments on all linked platforms when code is updated.

The back-end NodeJS server is hosted on Heroku - [https://mernstack-deployment.herokuapp.com]

The front-end ReactJS application is hosted on Netlify - [https://mernstack-deployment.netlify.app]

The application uses MongoDB, which is hosted on cloud as well.
